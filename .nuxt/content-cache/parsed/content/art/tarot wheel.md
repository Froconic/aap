title: Tarot Wheel
description: This is an image I made after seeing a similar graphic in the book Chicken Qaballah by Lon Milo Duquette. It gives you an at a glance relation between tarot and astrology. I recently got a new deck that did not have these associations on them so I made this as a print out I could fold and keep with my deck.
