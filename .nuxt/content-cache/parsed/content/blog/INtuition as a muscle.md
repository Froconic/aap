# Intuition Defined
I believe the intuition to be the process of the unconscious mind gathering information through the senses and presenting it to the conscious mind as a small voice, urge or inclination of awareness. This can be explained in many ways. The right brain processing information beyond what the left brain is aware of then transmitting it to the left brain in a capacity it can work with. Being the cup to receive energetic impressions and using the sword of discrimination to sort through what has been received. A guardian spirit giving you a nudge. The list goes on all useful lenses to look at the intuition through. But what is more useful than the what or why is how to apply this natural capacity in a practical sense.

# Clairs
'Clair' is French for 'clear'. Clear in the sense that you are receiving objective information unattached to emotional biases. I view the clairs as unbiased extensions of our normal senses. As you will see soon there is a clair for each of the senses. 

###### Clairaudience: Clear hearing. Receiving auditory information like a ringing in the ears, a voice in your head, a whisper in the wind.

###### Clairvoyance: Clear seeing. Seeing orbs of light, spirits and other unseen entities, having vision of the future, receiving visual impressions in response to a questions

###### Clairsentience: Clear feeling. Feeling the pain of someone who needs healing, a tingling spidey sense when danger or misfortune is nearby, feeling the energy of a room, feeling the presence of a spirit.

###### Clairgustance: Clear tasting. Tasting a familiar taste without eating food, Tasting the environment that something was made in, Tasting the emotions a food was cooked with, receiving a specific taste around others in a particular emotional state.

###### Clairolfaction: Clear Smell. Smelling a familiar smell when a spirit of a loved one on the other side is nearby, smelling the environments an item has been thru, smelling a specific scent around emotional states.

###### Claircognizance: Clear knowing. Suddenly knowing the answer to a question you have, knowing what is just about to happen, a nagging feeling in the back of your mind.

###### Clairempathy: Clear emotions. Feeling someone else's hidden emotions, feeling the argument that happened just before you arrived in a room, knowing how someone feels by being in their presence.

I believe that we first receive the knowing through claircognizance and then it is filtered through one of the other clairs if it is not grasped.

Here are some exercises you can do to strengthen your intuition. I will first list a couple quick exercises you can do to identify which of your clairs you have an aptitude for and then general exercises that can be applied to specific senses.

##### Object observation
1. Close your eyes and visualize a cube as vividly as possible.

1. Engage your senses and begin to feel the cube. 
1. Is it wooden, steel, cardboard or some other material?
1. Can you tap it? Is it hollow or a solid block?
1. What does it sound like?
1. Can you turn it into a cube of food? Cheese? Chocolate?
1. Can you taste it clearly?
1. What smell do you get from the cube?

Rate yourself on each one on how vivid each step was. The ones most vivid will be your stronger clairs.

##### Categorization 
1. This exercise can be utilized for most of the clairs and can be done with a deck of cards or paper and envelopes. If using cards grab 2 suits from the deck preferably of the same color to start. If using paper and envelopes you can use colors or numbers and make sure there are 2 of each you select. 
1. Shuffle the items after making sure there are at least 2 of each. Lay them out in front of you choosing to flip a card or see what is inside a random envelope. 
1. Now engage your senses as you observe any impressions you receive from the item you chose. Scan the items before you and see what feels similar to the one you chose. 
1. Select one and if it does match take them both out. If it does not shuffle everything and begin again. 
1. Count how many time you are correct versus how many time you are not. 

This is a great exercise in order to test any of the clairs and begin to lean into the ones that give the strongest impressions. How does red differ from black, 2 from a Jack etc. Take note of the impressions you receive and begin to see how these happen throughout your day to day.

#### General advice
- Take note of times you feel you are going to run into someone or when you think of someone just before they call or text you. What do you feel just before and what makes you think of them?
- Arriving at a stop light either walking or driving try to guess the moment it will turn green
- Observe people as you walk by what impressions do you get and what do they tell you about them? Can you weave a story of their life with the info given?
- When you ask yourself a question what impressions come right after. Do you feel a tingle, hear a voice, have a thought etc.
- When you feel an urge to do something out of the ordinary like take a backroad home or a new route in general follow it just to see what happens. Take note of anything of interest
- Using the colors in the rainbow begin to test each sense. What does red smell, taste, feel like? Compare between colors to better distinguish the differences.
- When you see someone who reminds you of someone else what is it that brings them to mind? The way they smell? The way they look? Their voice?

## Wrap up
Hopefully this information helps you in attuning and strengthening your intuition. It is a great tool we all have access to that can be strengthened through use and with its use confidence grows as a result. The more confident one can be in their intuition the more discernment is attained and the ability to flow increases as well. If you progress and need specific exercises for a clair or would like to discuss anything reach out I would love to be of help!
