This can be explained in many ways. The right brain processing information beyond what the left brain is aware of then transmitting it to the left brain in a capacity it can work with. Being the cup to receive energetic impressions and using the sword of discrimination to sort through what has been received. A guardian spirit giving you a nudge. The list goes on all useful lenses to look at the intuition through. But what is more useful than the what or why is how to apply this natural capacity in a practical sense."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"clairs"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Clairs"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"'Clair' is French for 'clear'.
