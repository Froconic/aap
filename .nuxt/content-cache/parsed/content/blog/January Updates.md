The first series is an icon pack I am working on. I realized as I was working on my website that there are not any icon packs focused on occult symbolism so I am working on creating one. Let me know if there are any symbols you feel are missing as you browse. The second series is a new series I am starting creating tile patterns with basic geometries.
