My general thought is to create a landing page that gives a brief overview of each section then have links that take you to different spaces. The blog and my art would of course be part of this but I may add spaces for a video library of Yoga, Taichi and movement practices. A space to talk about tarot and other divination systems and give readings. A space to showcase scripts and other coding technologies I develop like a script that given a word or phrase can convert that into a musical cipher that one could play. A space to consult on and accept web design and graphic design requests as well as have resources like web themes or components that could be purchased for use. But those will be slowly added over time."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"some-form-of-disciplined-schedule"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Some form of disciplined schedule"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As I get a handle on balancing life, work and everything else I will be finding the time to post regularly.

The regular weekly posts I aim to make medium length with the occasional longer length article (more metrics later). I don't use social media so the short and sporadic posts will be concise thoughts or things I wish to bring attention to like a quote that resonates or a commentary of a general situation."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"thanks-for-reading-and-blessings-be-upon-thee"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Thanks for reading and blessings be upon thee!"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"mod-language-interface","depth":3,"text":"MOD language interface"},{"id":"merch","depth":3,"text":"Merch"},{"id":"generative-art","depth":3,"text":"Generative art"},{"id":"map-of-the-dreamers-content","depth":3,"text":"Map of the Dreamers Content"},{"id":"site-expansion","depth":3,"text":"Site expansion?"},{"id":"some-form-of-disciplined-schedule","depth":3,"text":"Some form of disciplined schedule"},{"id":"thanks-for-reading-and-blessings-be-upon-thee","depth":2,"text":"Thanks for reading and blessings be upon thee!"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:blog:March-April Updates.md","_source":"content","_file":"blog/March-April Updates.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"Wb1vgSzXw6"}
