It will prove very useful for grounding and centering your energy and then drawing in fresh energy from the universe at large. This can be a great tool for simply resetting your energy before transitioning into a new situation, refreshing yourself for the day or getting to baseline before bed. I use it at least once a day before I step out of my home."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The concepts I have rolled into this meditation are establishing an octahedron from your core.

Take an inhale and reach up to connect to the Self exhaling to reach down and connect to the shadow. Now that you are connected begin to cycle energy. Excess energies within your field take on a dark murky mist like appearance. Take a deep breath breathe and as you inhale gather all of the excess energies from the past, present and future and ground it out as you exhale the energy down into the Shadow.
