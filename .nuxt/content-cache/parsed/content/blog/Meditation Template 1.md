# General Information
This is a meditation that I created as my practice evolved to incorporate more of my present understanding of the world and how I can interface with it. It will prove very useful for grounding and centering your energy and then drawing in fresh energy from the universe at large. This can be a great tool for simply resetting your energy before transitioning into a new situation, refreshing yourself for the day or getting to baseline before bed. I use it at least once a day before I step out of my home. 

The concepts I have rolled into this meditation are establishing an octahedron from your core. Grounding excess energy into the shadow. Reintegrating energy you have the capacity to from the shadow. Drawing down the energies you have the capacity to integrate from the Higher Self. And creating a vortex of energy to cycle this energy for continued renewal. 

The visualizations will get easier with practice and the basic pictures provided will aid in grasping the visuals. Once you have everything memorized and have gone through it a few times it should take you no more than 5-10 mins to complete.

# Procedures
1. Get into a comfortably seated position and begin to relax. Taking a few deep breathes releasing any unneeded tension held in the body. Begin to turn your attention from the external to the internal. Placing your awareness at your center wherever that may be for you.

2. Visualize an orb of pure white light emanating from your center.

  Acknowledge the directions around you establishing 'anchors' in each direction in front of you, behind you, to your left, to your right, up above and down below. These anchors will act the outer boundary of your field.

  After acknowledging and establishing the vectors take a deep breath in pulling your awareness back inward to the white orb at your center.

   Exhale connecting the anchors to one another to create an octahedron frame around you

   Take another deep breathe and as you exhale visualize a bubble emanating from your core expanding until it reaches the directional anchors you established. Take a moment to observe how you feel. This is the centering aspect of the meditation.

3. The next step is to connect to both the Self and Shadow Archetypes. Visualize 2 stars appearing outside of your field. One is above you with pure white light beaming out from it and you feel its heightened frequency emanating from it. This is the core of the Self. The second is below you and you see a darkness exude forth and hear a low hum. This is the core of the Shadow. Take an inhale and reach up to connect to the Self exhaling to reach down and connect to the shadow. Now that you are connected begin to cycle energy. Excess energies within your field take on a dark murky mist like appearance. Take a deep breath breathe and as you inhale gather all of the excess energies from the past, present and future and ground it out as you exhale the energy down into the Shadow. Take a moment to observe how you feel then inhale and bring grounded restorative energy up and through to the Self. Exhale and bring the energy back down through you and into the Shadow. 
4. From here feel free to continue to cycle the energies as you desire. When you are done. Take a moment to enjoy this moment of feeling fully present, grounded and restored before you return your awareness external and go about your day

# Advanced applications/ Added Notes
- This can be used before any major energy work
- Can be utilized to channel specific energies by placing the negative component to be channeled as the Shadow and the positive as the Self
- If acknowledging the Cardinal Directions is part of your practice they can easily be incorporated
- A Depth Psychology lens can be utilized sending excess energies into the Shadow  below and reintegrating what you have the capacity to and drawing energy from the Self archetype above
- Can be utilized for chakra cleansings: in the final diagram the cores would be replaced with chakras and extended (may create a visual for reference)
- Knowledge of circuit dynamics can help aid in application
- An Animation will be added as time allows
- These templates in the future might take on a whitepaper-esque layout as I move towards a more Techno-Sorcery lens (More on that in another post)
