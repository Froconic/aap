A basic definition of a sigil is a symbolic representation of specified intent. The intention can be anything from wanting a certain job, finding a romantic partner or even creating a business. The sigil takes conscious intent and embeds the information into an abstract form that allows the subconscious to unpack and work with."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"To back up just a bit let me explain the differences and interface between the conscious mind and unconscious mind. The consious mind can be thought of as a cup. Whatever is contained within the cup the conscious mind can actively work on. The unconscious mind can be seen as a body of water like a lake. The lake can be split into layers the subconscious would be the water closer to the surface, the unconscious being the deepest depth of the lake. I could include the collective unconscious in the example but that is beyond the practical application of sigils outlined in this article. As a sidenote to add another layer to this the conscious, subconscious and unconscious can be viewed as the human, mammalian and reptilian areas of the brain respectively."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The conscious mind communicates through verbal words, the subconscious through images and the unconscious through sensation. As you can see in the visual metaphor of the lake and cup there is a lot more of the subconscious and unconscious. So you can see that getting these 2 to work for you will do far more than what you can consciously do at any given moment. So to effectively focus these upon efforts you have to transform your willed intent into a form that the subconscious to work with an image."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are many ways to produce a sigil from an intention. Lets take BLESSINGS for example. The most common method would have the subject eliminate any vowels and duplicate letters. This gives us BLSNG as a sigil recipe. Now from here you can utilize the letters to construct an image or you can break the sigil recipe down further. More on why you would want to do this later. To break down the Sigil further you could take each letter and break them down into their base components. A B has one vertical line and to curves L has 2 straight lines etc. Looking at the base components you can then count all straight lines as masculine energy and curves as feminine. You now have a stroke count for your sigil. In constructing the sigil simplicity is king. If you can do the sigil all in one stroke even better. Create an image that seems magical to you whatever aesthetic that takes. Once you have your sigil in hand you will have to charge it to activate it."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are many methods to charge a sigil and these can be split into 2 categories: excitatory and inhibitory. Excitatory methods involve things like dancing until your mind is blank and you are sweaty and infusing the energy into the sigil. Masturbating and staring at the sigil during climax is another popular method. The basis behind excitatory methods is to generate"}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:blog:drafts:Sigil Tech.md","_source":"content","_file":"blog/drafts/Sigil Tech.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"KPkBIJ0ktQ"}
