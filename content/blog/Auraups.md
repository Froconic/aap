# Basics
This meditation will be useful for those interested in learning to work with and utilize the aura. The aura can also be called the energy body or auric body. With body being in the term you can assume that there are ways to interact and move it similar to our physical bodies. So this mediatation will prove useful in learning and attaining awareness of and control over the aura. 

# Steps
1. Get into a comfortable seated position and relax into your body. Center and ground in your preferred way.
2. Once grounded and centered take a deep breathe using your inhale bring all of your aura within your center. As you exhale expand your aura to fill the room you reside within fully. As you are exhaling explore any new sensations as your aura expands. Can you feel the air between you and the wall? Can you see what is to your left and right? Can you feel your physical body seperate from where your awareness is currently? Are there any things you feel now that you are not aware of normally in the room? Once you are at the end of your exhale take another inhale to bring the aura within your center. Repeat this 10 times.
3. After doing the first expansion 10 times now you are going to do the same thing except limit your expansion to fill half the room. This can be on a vertical or a horizontal split. Repeat 10x.
4. For this part you will only expand a few inches past your body. Repeat 10x.
5. After completing the exercise take a moment and notice how you feel. Do you feel more connected? Do you feel more intune with your own energetic flow?

# Advanced applications / Concepts
- You can play with seperating your aura and your body completely on the reps where you are only filling half the room
- If you are an anime and manga nerd like me you can look into any systems like Nen from Hunter X Hunter to develop other exercises to do
- Adding colors as well as playing with changing the properties of your aura can add a bit of challenge
- Focusing on one specific sense will aid in strengthening clair abilities
