# Merch Coming Soon

I am currently working on uploading my art to Society6 and Redbubble. I have over 140 designs on the website currently so I am chunking away at it one day at a time. If you want a sneak peek at what will be available for purchase check out this [link](https://society6.com/rivreofsoma). I'm setting these stores up in order to give more avenues of support that give you something worthwhile at the same time. I will add a seperate page once each store is done so you can browse on my site. If there are any designs that you really like and wish to get it on a T-shirt as opposed to a coaster and the design is not ready shoot me a message and I can work on getting that format for you. 

# New Artwork
Check out the art page for some new art for your eyes to consume. I was working on a project that will be revealed later but as I was working a flurry of ideas hit me as I saw small shapes and components so feel free to peruse and tell me what you think. The first series is an icon pack I am working on. I realized as I was working on my website that there are not any icon packs focused on occult symbolism so I am working on creating one. Let me know if there are any symbols you feel are missing as you browse. The second series is a new series I am starting creating tile patterns with basic geometries. Enjoy the view!

# Map Of The Dreamers
I am currently consolidating my notes on my research and experiments with the system. I will start rolling out articles this week in order to begin unraveling the system into a cohesive tapestry to work with. So look out for that if that is of your interest.

# Chat?
Would you like a chat feature on the site? I am tossing around the idea of coding my own chat feature but that's towards the bottom of my priorities on the site but, could be bumped up if the interest of engagement is there. Let me know!

# Thanks for visiting and blessings upon your day!
