# March things of note
### MOD language interface
I have a monogram I have been deconstructing for glyphs for the Map of the Dreamers systems. I will begin to roll out bits of that next month along with correspondence tables that go along with the system as a whole. I am still in the theory phase of the process and will be trying out different uses of the glyphs and detailing my experiments

### Merch
I have finished uploading the first round of designs to Redbubble. I will be done integrating those onto the related artworks with a button that takes you to a page that shows all the options available for the design. Hopefully, this won't overwhelm you since there are so many options! 

### Generative art
I have recently discovered generative art and am seeking to start learning the different techniques to add to my toolbelt. Look for these in April

# April aims
### Map of the Dreamers Content
I will be rolling out the correspondence tables for the systems starting with the elements and then progressing to the planets, zodiac and so on. I will most likely give each symbol its own page as well as create a simplified at a glance infographic as a resource.

### Site expansion?
I have been debating if I should open up the site to add more of my skills and interests to the mix. My general thought is to create a landing page that gives a brief overview of each section then have links that take you to different spaces. The blog and my art would of course be part of this but I may add spaces for a video library of Yoga, Taichi and movement practices. A space to talk about tarot and other divination systems and give readings. A space to showcase scripts and other coding technologies I develop like a script that given a word or phrase can convert that into a musical cipher that one could play. A space to consult on and accept web design and graphic design requests as well as have resources like web themes or components that could be purchased for use. But those will be slowly added over time.

### Some form of disciplined schedule
As I get a handle on balancing life, work and everything else I will be finding the time to post regularly. Most likely a weekly schedule with Wednesday being the day to post (Mercury and communication right?) along with sporadic posts of shorter length. The regular weekly posts I aim to make medium length with the occasional longer length article (more metrics later). I don't use social media so the short and sporadic posts will be concise thoughts or things I wish to bring attention to like a quote that resonates or a commentary of a general situation.
